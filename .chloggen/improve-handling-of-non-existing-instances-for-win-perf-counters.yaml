  It is an expected that when querying Windows Performance Counters the targeted instances may not be present.
  The receiver will no longer require the use of `recreate_query` to handle non-existing instances.
  As soon as the instances are available, the receiver will start collecting metrics for them.
  There won't be warning log messages when there are no matches for the configured instances.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
